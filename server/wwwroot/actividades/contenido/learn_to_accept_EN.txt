When you learn to accept your flaws, you learn how to be happy with who you are now until you get to where you want to be. 

You don’t compare yourself to those ahead of you and feel insecure about yourself and your accomplishments.

You don’t look at accepting your flaws as complacency or lack of ambition, you look at it as compassion and self-love; knowing you’ll never be perfect, you’ll never look a certain way and you’ll never entirely love everything about yourself but that won’t stop you from embracing your flaws.
